# **Generative AI Blog Generator**

---

## **Methodology**

I designed the **Generative AI Blog Generator** to simplify blog creation using advanced natural language processing capabilities of the **LLaMA 2 model**. The application is structured to take user inputs and generate cohesive blog content tailored to specific audiences. The project is modular and PEP-8 compliant, ensuring scalability and readability.  

### Key Steps in the Methodology:
1. **User Input Collection**: The application captures user-provided blog topics, word count, and target audience type through an intuitive Streamlit interface.
2. **Dynamic Prompting**: A custom template converts the inputs into structured prompts for the LLaMA 2 model.
3. **Model Interaction**: The **CTransformers** library powers the LLaMA 2 model to generate blog content based on the prompt.
4. **Response Handling**: The model's output is processed and displayed in real time for users to review.
